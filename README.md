# ShapeCalculations

### Coding Assessment Submission for Abigail Musser

NOTE: THIS REPO WILL BE SET TO PRIVATE STARTING ON 9/20/2024 UNLESS REQUESTED OTHERWISE BEFORE THIS DATE.

Program reads shape data from a csv file (`ShapeList2.csv`), performs area and perimeter calculations on each shape, and writes to a new csv file (`output.csv`) containing the geometric properties of each shape using the format: `{row_id, area, perimeter}`. To run this program as intended, the input csv file, `ShapeList2.csv`, must be in the bin/Debug/net6.0 directory or equivalent (the directory containing the .dll and console application itself). The output file, `output.csv` can be found in the same location once the program is run.

Created as a Visual Studio console app between 8/20/2024 and 8/31/2024. Code written by Abigail Musser in C#. Shoelace formula obtained from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula and any other sources cited within comments in the code. The only edits to this repo since 9/1/2024 were in the creation of this README.
